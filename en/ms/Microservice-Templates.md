A good source code template beats all training sessions.
Especially for microservices architecture, you might have more than 10 git repos to form a complete application. And a small team owns one or more repos. Although each team can have its own style in software development, a consistent code structure and examples save a lot of time on making small decisions or reinventing the wheel. For example, test frameworks, pipeline steps and so on.
