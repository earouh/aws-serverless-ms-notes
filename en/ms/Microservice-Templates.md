A good source code template beats all training sessions, especially for microservices architecture. You might have more than 10 Git repos to form a complete application and several small teams own one or a few repos. In this case, each team could do many things alike. Such as test framework, pipeline steps and so on. A source code template with thoughtful structures and examples saves a lot of time on reinventing the wheels.
