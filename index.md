This website collects my ideas and work experiences about using the following technologies:

- Microservices
- AWS Serverless
- NodeJS (by no means the only choice)

These technologies benefit building large-scale web applications in several aspects such as:

- Cost efficiency (Serverless)
- Scalability and Resilience (Serverless and Microservices)
- Monitoring only application layer (Serverless)
- Easy to build small teams with less dependencies (Microservices)
- Easy to learn (NodeJS)
- Lower complexity at service level (Microservices)
- Higher testability (Microservices and NodeJS)

I wouldn't tell you too much how good these technologies are, but sharing my experiences tackling the real-world challenges.
